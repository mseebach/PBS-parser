PBS Parser
==========

This is a library for dealing with PBS aka. Nets.eu 'BetalingsService' (Danish Direct Debit service). This service functions by exchanging files in deliveries, either through a webinterface or a SFTP connection or by other means. This library is designed to deal with those files, both parsing incoming files and generating outgoing files.

The library is mostly incomplete, and likely to stay that way, as I only have a real-world use for a certain subset of it. If you need it to do something else/more, please to get in touch. 

The library is licensed under the FreeBSD license, which allows you to do pretty much whatever you want. I'd appreciate to hear from anyone using this, though.
